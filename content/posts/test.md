The objective here is to own a motorcycle for free, or at-least at a very cheap price.

**The skills I have:**

1)Know my way around motorcycle mechanics

2)Have a fairly good understanding of the market prices

3)Have access to insurance auctions

4)Own a car capable of towing trailers

**What I don't have:**

1) Enough funds to buy a decent condition motorcycle

2) Willingness to spend good money

**Put that all in perspective, my options are:**

1)Travel far and wide if there is a good deal and transport the motorcycle back home.

2)Buy a damaged bike and fix it up over time, but then again, it wouldn't be free.

So here is what happened;

Bought a good motorcycle for cheap. How? From insurance auction as a stolen and recovered listing. It was cheap as it was de-registered. To put it in simple terms, getting it back on road would require lot of inspection and paper work. Hence the cheap price. Was too lazy to go and collect it, so I asked around and found a decent courier who can deliver it to me for a decent price.

Found a below average condition bike that is about 2 hours away and got it back in a trailer and purchased a live(registered) frame from a wrecker. Swapped the good parts of the good bike to the bad bike and got a warrant of fitness and then put then on the live frame and got that warranted. So now we have two bikes that are registered and warranted. Sold the bad bike at a very reasonable cost stating all the issues, which still covered the money spend on purchasing both the bikes making the good bike we have essentially free!
