The objective here is to own a motorcycle for free, or atleast a very cheap price.

The skills I have:

1) Know my way around motorcycle mechanics

2)Have a fairly good understanding of the market prices

3)Have access to insurance auctions

4)Own a car capable of towing trailers



What I don't have:

1) Enough funds to buy a decent condition motorcycle

2)Willingness to spend good money



Put that all in perspective, my options are:

1)Travel far and wide if there is a good deal and transport the motorcycle back home.

2)Buy a damaged bike and fix it up over time, but then again, it wouldnt be free.



So here is what I did.

I bought a good motorcycle for cheap. How? From insurance auction as a stolen and recovered listing. It was cheap as it was de-registered. To put it in simple terms, getting it back on road would require lot of inspection and paper work. Hence the cheap price. Was too lazy to go and collect it, so I asked around and found a decent courier who can deliver it to me for a decent price.



Waited around to find a below average condition bike that is about 2 hours from my place.
