The objective here is to own a motorcycle for free, or at least at a very cheap price. One lesson I've learned on my experience with the Yamaha R15 is that the motorcycle needs to be heavy and aerodynamic to have a comfortable ride on the motorway as it is too windy. Unlike many other countries, New Zealand doesn't have a great motorcycle range to choose from. Since the options are limited, I have to work with what I can find.

**The skills I have:**

* Know my way around motorcycle mechanics
* Have a fairly good understanding of the market prices
* Have access to insurance auctions
* Own a car capable of towing trailers

**What I don't have:**

* Enough funds to buy a decent condition motorcycle
* Willingness to spend good money

**Put those in perspective, my options are:**

1. If there is a good deal(which most likely happens in remote areas), I would be able to collect it.
2. Buy a damaged bike and fix it up over time, but then again, it wouldn't be free.

**Here is what I did;**

I combined my options! Bought a good motorcycle for cheap. How? From insurance auction as a stolen and recovered listing. It was cheap as it was de-registered. To put it in simple terms, getting it back on road would require a lot of inspection and paperwork. Hence cheap.

Found a below-average condition bike that is about 2 hours away and got it back in a trailer and purchased a live(registered) frame from a wrecker the same day on the way back. Next step, swap all the stuff from the de-registered bike to the live frame. Voila! we have a registered bike.

Moving on, every motor vehicle has to clear a safety inspection once a year. Its called a Warrant of Fitness(WOF) in NZ. Both of mine don't have one. Swapped the good parts of the good bike into the bad bike and got it inspected. Once that's done, I did the same for the other bike, and now I have two warranted bikes.

Sold the bad bike at a very reasonable price considering all the issues, which still covered the money spend on purchasing both the bikes making the good bike essentially free!!
